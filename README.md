## 🚀 Prototype Overview

Imagine opening a 20-page rental agreement and actually understanding it in 2 minutes. That's what LawLight does:

- **Upload any contract** (rental, loan, employment): Summarizes the content in plain language—no more legal jargon confusion.
- **Highlights risky clauses** and potential traps: Flags what may be problematic before signing.
- **Interactive chatbot:** Tweak scenarios (late payments, early termination), see instant outcomes.
- **Ask questions naturally:** “Can my rent increase after 6 months?” Get friendly, easy-to-understand answers.
- **Visual flowcharts:** See how decisions could unfold like a “choose your own adventure” for contracts.
- **Works with local languages** & India-ready law adjustments.
